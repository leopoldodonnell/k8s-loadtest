# Locust will be directed to the System Under Test (sut) determined
# by the value of `task.targetHost` found in subdirectory of the
# sut's git repository within `taskDir`.
#
# Setup the System Under Test:
#  targetHost: the URI endpoint that will be targeted by locust
#  taskDir: the relative subdirectory in the git repository where
#            the 'tasks.py' locust task entrypoint is found
#  tasks: the python file relative to taskDir with the tasks to run
# 
# Setup the git repository:
#  repo: is the ssh URI that you would specify in your git command
#  dest: is the directory where the project will be found. You would
#        typically set it to the name of the repository
#  branch: the git branch to 'checkout'
#  refresh: how often to refresh the files from git
